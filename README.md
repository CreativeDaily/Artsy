# Blendy
Blender models created regularly just for fun.

I'm try to do two things with this repository:

1. Develop Blender skills
1. Improve the skill of "shipping often"

I'm inspired by the [daily self portraits of Android Jones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7wV31YgKOk) and [Beeple's 13 years of daily art and counting](https://www.instagram.com/beeple_crap/). So I'm trying to create regularly (not actually daily but often) simple 3D models.

My models are free to use, MIT licensed, and generally optimized either for video game development use or just me screwing around learning stuff.
